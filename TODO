15> Start Up Hang Debug       => Done
    USB was causing constant ESOF interrupt.
    Need to change USB DP pullup from 4.7K to 1.5K
    Guess noise was the primary issue
16> I2C Debug                 => Done
    Guess too high pull-up register was causing the problem.
    Passed 12 hour test with lesser pull-ups

16> Gyro/Accel/Mag calibration
  a) accel calibration
     to find offset/scale.
     6 step calibration expecting 1G for each unit axis

  b) gyro calibration
     to find offset
     should be zero when stationary

  c) magnetometer calibration
     c.1) to find bias
      just find min/max value and divide the sum by 2 to find center

     c.2) to find scale
      ??? still don't understand
      https://teslabs.com/articles/magnetometer-calibration/

        c.2.1) scale factor to fit points in sphere
        c.2.2) cross factor for each axises' perpendicularity to each
        other
