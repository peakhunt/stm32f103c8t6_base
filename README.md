# stm32f103c8t6_base

## introduction
This is a small/simple bare-metal based framework for writing stm32f1 firmware with CubeMX.
At the moment it supports event dispatcher and timer. 
All the application codes are running in a kind of single threaded application.

If you need hard real-time, maybe you will have to change interrupt priority.

Along the development, I was quite interested in developing an IMU(Inertial Motion Unit), which is still a work in progress.

Hope you enjoy! Guess the cude is quite easy to follow.
